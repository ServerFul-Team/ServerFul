## Components

### Pterodactyl Panel

We will utilize the [Pterodactyl Panel](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/blob/1.0-develop/docker-compose.example.yml) to manage user access and configurations for the VPS. The panel provides a comprehensive web interface for server management.

### Pterodactyl Wings

For the backend infrastructure, we will deploy [Pterodactyl Wings](https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/blob/develop/docker-compose.example.yml). Wings acts as the daemon that interacts with the game servers and handles server operations.

### Custom Egg

We will incorporate a [Custom Egg](https://github.com/ysdragon/Pterodactyl-VPS-Egg) developed by [DraGoN](https://github.com/ysdragon) and [_David_](https://github.com/davidpr0811). This custom configuration will enhance the VPS management according to our project needs.

### Optional Module: Heliactyl

An optional module, [Heliactyl](https://github.com/OpenHeliactyl/Heliactyl), can be integrated to extend the functionalities of the Pterodactyl panel, providing additional features for managing VPS resources.

## Milestones

Our initial milestone is to complete the **Website Design**. This phase will set the groundwork for user interaction and overall user experience.

## Conclusion

We are excited to start this journey with Serverful! Happy coding and happy open-source development!
